# Arecace Website
## Overview
The website for my original worldbuilding and story project set on the fictional planet Arecace. All of the writing and the majority of the art for Arecace were created by me. This was the first website I developed in Angular and remains my testing ground to figure out how to build new web components or learn new techniques.
