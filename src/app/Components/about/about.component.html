      <!-- I'm kArA, the creator of Arecace.  I’m a PhD candidate in the sciences expecting to finish up grad school this May.  Art and story-craft are my main hobbies, and I am entirely self-taught.  Never think I have talent!  I practiced for years, and it is the hard work I put in to get here that should strike you, not any notions of innate skill. -->

        <!-- <p>I originally started drawing in ‘04, because it was the “in” thing with the friends group I was trying to join.  I fairy quickly steered away from fanart and random drawings towards developing characters and stories, though the stories were pretty basic.  I started putting together a large cast for the story that would eventually be AnK together and started my first test comic in 2007.  By the time I finished the first page of the actual story in 2008, I had renamed it to AnK.  Over the next few years, I realized how weak my story was, so I started thinking more about character motivations and wondering what exactly my setting was.   In 2012, I took my first few tentative steps in world building and have never turned back.  As it stands now, I continue to combine my imagination, strong sense of character voice, background in science, and a lot of on-the-spot research to build a fantasy world that is distinct and believable with a cast of characters that are both vitally flawed and sympathetic.</p>
            
        <p>AnK is made of 4 primary story arcs that follow my main cast.  Additionally, there are three “history” side arcs that cover critical periods in Arecaec’s history (the Last War, the Winter Rainforest Campaign and the future arc for which I don’t have a name of the event yet).  There is also a side project that is aimed at an entirely different audience that I intend to write out as screen plays if I ever have the time.</p> -->

    <div *ngIf="contentPicker === 1" class="textblock" role="alert" [innerHTML]="mainText.Me">
        <!-- <p>I am currently attending Vanderbilt University, working under Dr. Nicole Creanza. I spent the first half of my PhD studying the molecular mechanisms that determine whether neurons form dendritic spines or dendritic branches.  When my first advisor passed away, I had to start over my PhD.  I switched to studying and simulating birdsong evolution using computation techniques.  I'm currently looking for carrers outside of acedemia where coding is a large part of my day-to-day tasks and where my credential as soon-to-be PhD would be valuable.</p> 
            
        <p>Overall, I feel my greatest skills are boxed into art/writing and coding/science.  It has been said that my interests and skills, ranging from technical to creative, make it look like I am unfocused.  In reality, I have this disparate skillset because I can see how these fields form an interface to accomplish my greater goals; I want my creative projects to be immersive, which requires a deep understanding of how the world really works.  I want people to understand and remember my science, which requires an understanding of how people perceive words and visuals.  Overall, I am an adaptable jack-of-all trades, picking up whatever skills I need to accomplish the task at hand.</p> -->

    <div *ngIf="contentPicker === 2" class="textblock" role="alert" [innerHTML]="mainText.Website">
        <!-- <p>I started this website thinking that I would just make some pretty pages with my limited front-end skills and be done with it two weeks.  Instead, I accidently became a full-stack developer in three weeks and finished the initial release in a month and a half.  The website is built in Angular 7, and as such is a single-page application.  The website is hosted through firebase and all images and much of the text is pulled from firestore + firebase storage.  I have tried to follow best practices suggested by the angular documentation, meaning that I create a component for each standalone feature and package them as modules for reuse as needed (e.g. the sidebar on many of the worldbuilding pages).  Functionally related components are also bundled into modules, which have their own child routers.  Resolvers are used when data from firebase is required for a substantial part of rendering a component or if I am using child routes with dynamic IDs (frequently both are true at the same time).  I generally use services to communicate between parent/child and sibling components.  I created an administrative section protected by an auth guard that waits for validation handled through firebase.  This section allows me to upload content to self-designed templates (made using forms), which is then pushed to firestore and storage in the correct format for display on the main website.  I can also edit and delete existing content through this interface.</p>

        <ul>Features I am currently working to include:
            <li>A “which Guild would hire you” survey for playground</li>
            <li>Calculated Source Affinity cost for a given set of abilities for playground</li>
            <li>Recently added feed for the home page </li>
            <li>Misc Art tab</li>
