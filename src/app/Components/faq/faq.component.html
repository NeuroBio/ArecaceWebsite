<!-- QUESTIONS -->
<div id="splatter">
  <br/>
  <ol>
    <li>Are you going to redraw the early chapters of AnK?
      <div class="inList">I 100% intend to redraw them all.  The early chapters of arc 1 are no longer relevant to the script I have since written.  I’m feeling comfortable with my figures, but I’m still working on backgrounds and staging.  I think by the time I have finished arc 1, I will be skilled enough to redo it, so I will alternate between drawing pages of arc 1 and continuing into arc 2.</div>
    </li><br/><br/>

    <li>How did you get so good at art or storycraft or worldbuilding or whatever?
      <div class="inList">The same way you get good at anything; practice, research, and seeking critique.</div>
    </li><br/><br/>

    <li>Is there anyway I can get involved in this project?
      <div class="inList">As much as I’d like too, I can’t afford to pay an artist to help me.  Other the other hand, beta-reading services I may be able to afford and desperately want and need.  Otherwise, just tell other people about what I’m doing and help me grow a community.</div>
    </li>
    <br/><br/>

    <li>I have a fairuse case; how do I cite you?
      <div class="inList">I have info on that <a routerLink="fanpolicy">here</a>.</div>
    </li>
      <br/><br/>

    <li>Can I use your art as a reference?
      <div class="inList">To get the appearance of my characters or creatures right?  Yeah.   For poses or to create a human-drawn photocopy of what I made?  No.  You should be referencing photos if anything, because otherwise you'll just end up copying my mistakes.</div>
    </li>
    <br/><br/>

    <li>Should I contact you if someone using your art?
      <div class="inList">Is that one using it for the sake of satire, critique, or other fairuse puposes?  If so, I wouldn't mind seeing it, but fairuse is fairuse, so it's nothing to be concerned about.  Is that one selling or tracing my art?  Please inform me.</div>
    </li><br/><br/>

    <li>Do you mind if I make fanart?

      <div class="inList">Yes and no.
        <p><u>Want to make me gift art?</u><br/>  Go for it.  I am happy to look at this.</p>
        <p><u>Want to create general fanart and fan fiction?</u><br/>  Make it all you want, post it if you absolutely must, but keep it away from me for both of our own goods.  I don’t want fights about how I was “copying” your fanworks in my original story.</p>
        <p><u>Want to sell my art, only redrawn by you?</u><br/>  No.</p>
        <p><u>Want to sell art you made related to my world and stories?</u><br/>  You should ask me.</p>

        <nav>In the long run, as I get my canon stuff done, I may be more flexible to ideas like making a site section for fan work and be willing to look at/make fun of it, but I need control over this right now.
        My full stance on being a respectful fan is <a routerLink="fanpolicy">here</a>.</nav>

    <li>Where do you get your ideas?
      <div class="inList">No where and everywhere.  By and large, I’ll see something cool in real life (like tanystropheus skeletons) and decide it’s so cool I want it in my world.  As I am adding that feature, I think about how it affects my existing features (they live in the Fraxin range and browse in the tide pools), and this ends up building other features (big friendly lizards are cool, so people adopt them by giving them shell necklaces).  For the story itself, I usually figure out who the big bad is, what that one wants and why, and then decide how that one loses (or how much that one gains).  Then I pick a starting point before that ending, figure out a few key events, and my characters fill in the journey.  Usually, I stumble into subplots.  Once I realize I have one I, again, figure out the major events for it and then let the characters fill it in.  It can accidently make for some very dense concepts that are built heavily on things before and after the story arcs that the reader only sees pieces of (e.g. Drake and Shizame’s extremely poor relationship, Yume’s baggage from growing up on Salix, the full reasons Mathaeis is so fed up with Deparia and how he really was turning into a nasty person there).  I wish I didn’t have to condense so much of that info, because I know the whole story, but I don’t have time to give everything a 20-page background dump.</div>
