          <h3>What is this?</h3><br>
          The Travelerâ€™s Guide is an over 300 page-long document where I have compiled all of my world building info about Arecace.  This includes information and images not currently present on this website or my deviantArt account and some that was never released publicly.  It is available only in electronic form, so that it can retain its hyperlink system for quick referencing.  When you buy, you will get two copies; one has an off-white background that I feel is easier to read on bright screens and feels more like a real document.  The other has a white background for printing purposes.

              Sorry, it's not available yet!  I'm still adding key content and editing the text.  I expect to be finished before the end of 2019.
