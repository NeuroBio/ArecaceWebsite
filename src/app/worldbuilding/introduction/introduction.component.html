            <h3>The Planet:</h3>
            <p>Arecace is a Mars-sized planet that has an additional physical force, called "Source,‚Äù which is essentially life energy.  It is an integral part of all living organisms, but more importantly, it is the foundation for the magic system in the story.   Source is a kind of energy that by itself can become concentrated, dispersed, organized, or disorganized, but it can also affect matter at the atomic level or even be converted into matter or other types of energy.</p>

            <h3>The People:</h3>
            <p>The analog of the <i>Homo sapiens</i> analog on Arecace, <i>Homo navitas</i>, has evolved to be able to manipulate Source.  Most Arecacen humans have little to no Source Affinity and cannot control it.  They are termed Sourceless, though technically they, like other life forms, possess an internal network of Source that is analogous to a soul, a Source Configuration.  The remaining Arecacens, Source Magicians, can control Source and develop Source Abilities.  Source is not a hidden element in Arecacen society.  Sourceless and Source Magicians can come from the same family, and often do, so there are no major conflicts between them.  However, one grop of people, the shape-shifting Esarians, are looked down upon by everyone else.</p>

            <h3>A History of Conflict:</h3>
            <p>The "Esarian problem" has its roots in the Last War.  The Esarian Jasper waged a campaign to conquer the continent of Catheste; however his efforts soon spiraled into the total devastation of the continent before he turned his sights on the rest of the planet.  Jasper was eventually stopped when he landed on Eriast, and the remaining territories united to defeat his army.  Even though Esarians had fought on both sides of this war, the destruction Jasper incurred sowed the seeds of distrust and hatred towards all Esarians.  Immediately following the war, the remaining territories negotiated a new set of legislation, the Preservation Laws, to prevent another Jasper from rising.  They also created a central body, the Department of Interterritorial Affiars (DIA), to enforce them.  These new laws placed limitations on the rights of Esarians.  In the modern era, not quite 300 years later, Esarians have been rebelling and protesting to have equal rights restored to them for over a century.  As many of their demonstrations lead to violent riots, the DIA has refused to grant them equality thus far.</p>

            <h3>The Balance of Power:</h3>
            <p>Although the Preservation Laws outlawed military forces and soldiers, the DIA maintains a small number of combat trained units they term Assassins.  To assist the DIA, there are also seven Guilds, which were created as an attempt to decentralize the DIA's power following accusations of corruption.  Legally, the Guilds are just satellites of the DIA, which are located in different regions of Arecace.  In practice, all the Guilds align more strongly with their local territories than with the central government.  Together, the Guilds form a counsel that is supposed to be of equal power to the DIA, though the DIA has many tactics to subvert this balance.</p>

            <h3>The Story:</h3>
            <p>Esarian Guildmaster Cyden Eda seeks to ignite war with the DIA to gain control of the planet and force the world to give Esarians equal rights.  His nephew, Drake, a highly trained Assassin in the Guild, believes that Cyden will become a tyrant and seeks to stop him.  Both wish to recruit the assistance of Mathaeis, a teen who Cyden claims is the reincarnation of a top-tier Esarian Source Magician.</p>
